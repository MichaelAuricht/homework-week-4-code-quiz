Homework Week #4

I need to create a timed multiple-choice quiz that tracks the score of the user using updating HTML and CSS powered by Javascript.

I will build in HTML and CSS first to get a general idea of how the quiz should look, then rebuild using Javascript.

A button should be used to start the quiz, and any answer will proceed to the next question while letting the user know if the answer is correct or wrong.

At the end of the quiz, the user will be shown the score and allowed to type in their initials, which will go into a list of highscores.

My goal is to have the bare minimum HTML and CSS and have everything be built in JS.

--after completion of project--

There are 5 questions asked and the user has 30 seconds to complete the quiz. Each time they get an answer wrong they lose 5 seconds. For each correct answer they get 5 points. At the end their remaining time is added to their score.

at the end of the quiz they have the option to store their score under their initials which are stored locally (localstorage).

they can also access the high scores page at any time via the button in the top left corner.
